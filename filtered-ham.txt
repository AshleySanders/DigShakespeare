I remember one said sallets lines make matter savory, matter phrase might indict author affection, called honest method, wholesome sweet and, much, handsome fine. One speech 't, I chiefly loved. Twas, Aeneas tale Dido, thereabout especially speaks Priam's, slaughter. If live memory, begin line--let see, let see: The rugged Pyrrhus, like th Hyrcanian beast-- tis, so; begins Pyrrhus: The rugged Pyrrhus, whose sable arms, Black purpose, night resemble When lay couched th ominous horse, Hath dread black complexion smeared With heraldry dismal.

So painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood And, like neutral matter, Did nothing. But often see storm A silence heavens, rack stand still, The bold winds speechless, orb As hush death, anon dreadful thunder Doth rend region; so, Pyrrhus pause, Aroused vengeance sets new 'a-work, And never Cyclops hammers fall On Mars's, armor, forged proof eterne, With less remorse Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falls Priam.
