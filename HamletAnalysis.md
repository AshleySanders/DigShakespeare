  <p>Next let's compare the trends of the most frequent words in the soliloquies and some of the most representative vocabulary from the play, broken into scenes:</p>

<h3><b>Trends of the Most Frequent Words in the Soliloquies:</b></h3>

<p>At the end of the first act, during rising action, the word <b>villain</b> dominates Hamlet’s soliloquy, as he rails against a "villain," following the ghost's visit and news that Claudius murdered King Hamlet. It would seem that the word "villain" must refer to the murderer, but it does not. Right after swearing that he would remember his father and the ghost's command to kill Claudius, "unmix'd with baser matter," Hamlet immediately does what he has just sworn he would not. Not only does he put his father's murder out of mind, he mixes it with the most base matter of all - the fact that his mother is sleeping with his uncle. <em>She</em> is the <b>villain</b>. And herein lies the seed of Hamlet's delay and downfall - his obsession with his mother's betrayal.</p>

<p>Just before the climax of the play, the only frequent word in Hamlet’s soliloquy (in Act 3, scene 1) is <b>sleep</b>, by which he means death, specifically suicide, as he contemplates the potential consequences of his own death/suicide. Between II.2 and III.3, the word <b>i’ll</b> disappears, but comes back in III.3 - as Hamlet prepares to kill Claudius ("And now I'll do 't.") but then realizes that Claudius may go to a heaven as a result since he is praying. Using KWIC, we can see that the word <b>i'll</b> in Hamlet's soliloquies indicates the opposite of decisive action and, instead, punctuates Hamlet's plotting and delay. In Hamlet’s last soliloquy (IV.4), <b>sleep</b> again appears as the most frequent word. Here, rather than referring to death, "sleep" is a metaphor for Hamlet's inaction as he compares his delay with the fortitude and bold action of Fortinbras's army going to war. This is an apropos metaphor because it is Hamlet's inaction, or "sleep," that brings about everyone's death, or eternal "sleep."</p>
