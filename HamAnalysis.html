<p class="ex1">Let's compare the trends of the most frequent words in the soliloquies and some of the most representative vocabulary from the play, broken into scenes:</p>

<h3><b>Trends of the Most Frequent Words in the Soliloquies:</b></h3>

<iframe width="1000" height="500" src="https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?view=Trends&bins=7&corpus=daaa71e1acbe221ad2ea67a0e66cba63"> </iframe>

<p class="ex1">At the end of the first act, during the rising action of the play, the word <b>villain</b> dominates Hamlet’s second soliloquy, as he rails against a "villain," following the ghost's visit and news that Claudius murdered King Hamlet. It would seem that the word "villain" must refer to the murderer, but it does not. Right after swearing that he would remember his father and the ghost's command to kill Claudius, "unmix'd with baser matter," Hamlet immediately does what he has just sworn he would not. Not only does he put his father's murder out of mind, but he  is then consumed by the most base matter of all - the fact that his mother is sleeping with his uncle. <em>She</em> is the <b>villain</b>. And herein lies the seed of Hamlet's fateful delay.</p>

<p class="ex1">Just before the climax of the play, the only frequent word in Hamlet’s soliloquy (in Act 3, Scene 1) is <b>sleep</b>, by which he means death, specifically suicide, as he contemplates the potential consequences of his own death/suicide. Between 2.2 and 3.3, the word <b>i’ll</b> disappears, but comes back in 3.3 - as Hamlet prepares to kill Claudius ("And now I'll do 't.") but then realizes that Claudius may go to a heaven as a result since he is praying. Using KWIC, we can see that the word <b>i'll</b> in Hamlet's soliloquies indicates the opposite of decisive action and, instead, punctuates Hamlet's plotting and delay. In Hamlet’s last soliloquy (4.4), <b>sleep</b> again appears as the most frequent word. Here, rather than referring to death, "sleep" is a metaphor for Hamlet's inaction as he compares his delay with the fortitude and bold action of Fortinbras's army going to war. This is an apropos metaphor because it is Hamlet's inaction, or "sleep," that brings about everyone's death, or eternal "sleep." </p>

<h3><b>Trends of the Most Representative Words in the Play:</b></h3>

<iframe width="1000" height="500" src="https://voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?view=Trends&stopList=keywords-c576000cac60b0f03eab1b1e76a136bb&query=soul*&query=shall*&query=villain*&query=moth*&query=father*&bins=20&corpus=1ada137c18a69d58bfe64dd0c029ad16"> </iframe>

<p class="ex1">One of the key plot points is revealed in the above Trends graph of the words shall, father, mother, soul, and villain. These words are not necessarily the most frequent, but they were chosen as some of the most informative words in the text. The word <b>father</b> appears most frequently at the beginning of the play, when Hamlet learns of his murder and vows revenge, and just before the tragic end when in Act 4, Scene 5, Ophelia has gone mad with grief after her own father's murder at Hamlet's hand. In between, the words <b>mother</b> and <b>villain</b>, which Hamlet often uses in reference to his mother, appear more frequently than the word <b>father</b>, demonstrating Hamlet's obsession over his mother's betrayal. <b>Shall</b> <em>is</em> one of the most frequent words in the play, indicating an <em>intent</em> to act rather than action, and thus, Hamlet's fatal delay.</p>

<p class="ex1">It is true that the above observations merely confirm what we already know from a close reading of the play. Similarly, examining the most frequent terms in play simply shows that the narrative unfolds through speech and thinking, rather than action:
<b>Most frequent words in the corpus:</b> shall (118); good (108); come (107); let (96); like (82); sir (77); know (75); tis (73); th (71); love (69); hath (65); <b>speak (64)</b>; i'll (55); make (55); man (54); <b>say (54)</b>; father (53); <b>think (49)</b>; time (46); heaven (45).

However, this was and is an important first step in any analysis. It gives us confidence that the tools we are using and the insights we are generating are valid because they confirm some of our observations and suspicions developed during close reading. This bolsters our confidence that we might generate some meaningful new understandings when we begin to apply these, and other, tools to works that we have not read or with which we are less familiar. </p> 

<p class="ex1">However, if we dig a little further and focus on the seemingly common word, <b>come</b>, we find that it indicates power, authority, and hierarchy. When it is used as an imperative, as in, "Come [here]," it signals the characters who have the ability to issue such commands and to whom. By looking at the speakers and their hearers, we can create a hierarchy of the power relationships in this play. This idea first came to me when I explored the Bubblelines tool and noticed the word "come" as one of the most frequent words. I wondered if the word was used as a command and if it was an imperative given more often to women than to men. However, my subsequent exploration took a different path that led to interesting and previously unnoticed evidence for a hypthoesis about the threat that Hamlet posed to Claudius and Claudius' perception of his nephew.</p>

<p class="ex1">We can use the Contexts and Reader tools to examine each case in which "come" appears in the text to develop the hierarchy. For instance, the first appearance of the use of the "come" as an imperative is Claudius speaking to Gertrude. In the second instance, Polonius is admonishing his daughter, Ophelia, who responds,"I shall obey, my lord."  We can also examine cases in which a command is given but not obeyed, as is frequently the case between Gertrude and Hamlet. Almost every time she tries to issue an imperative, Hamlet's response is obstinate. In 3.2.115-117, Gertrude requests Hamlet to sit by her, "Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me." To which Hamlet replies, "No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive," and sits near Ophelia. This appears innocent enough, but Hamlet's response becomes much more aggressive in Act 3, Scene 4 when confronting Gertrude with her quick remarriage and even upends the parent-child power relationship by issuing multiple commands to Gertrude in response to her use of the imperative "come."</p>

<p class="ex1">The only time we see Claudius issue this particular imperative to Hamlet is in the final scene of the play in which he has conspired to kill his step-son/nephew. We suspect that Claudius is worried that Hamlet will expose his treachery, thereby thwarting all his work to attain the throne. Cladius', perhaps unrecognized, abstention from issuing a command to Hamlet that authority figures commonly used with those of inferior status throughout the play suggests an additional hypothesis. Until the moment when Claudius believes he has won and Hamlet is about to die, he implicitly recognizes Hamlet as the rightful heir to the throne by refraining from issuing the command, "come." This is a hypothesis that could be further tested with more sophisticated and flexible tools, such as the Natural Language Toolkit package for Python.</p>
