Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Bernardo?
You come most carefully upon your hour.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
Not a mouse stirring.
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?

Give you good night.
Bernardo hath my place.
Give you good night.
