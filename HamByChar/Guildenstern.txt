But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.
Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him!
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
