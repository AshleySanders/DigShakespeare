Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause 'a will by no means speak.
Most like a gentleman.
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'erraught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are here about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
We shall, my lord.

The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
The lives of many. The cess of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it; or it is a massy wheel,
Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoined; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Ho, bring in the lord.

Will't please you go, my lord?
