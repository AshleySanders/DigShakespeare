  <h3><b>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</b></h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explain what preprocessing is, why it is important, and the options available.</li>
    <li>Explain what collocates are, how they are identified, and at least one way to score them.</li>
    <li>Use instructor-defined heuristic framework to analyze collocates from Othello.</li>
    <li>Extend analysis beyond a single character and beyond a single play.</li>
    <li>For NLTK group: Be able to modify Python script to identify and score collocates and explain how/why this modification might be useful <b>AND/OR</b> visualize collocate data using NumPy library.</li>
    <li>Explain what topic modeling is and some of the ways it may be used.</li>
    <li>Generate and use topic models to explore the collection of works we are studying this semester and make predictions about the works we have yet to read.</li>

  <h3><b>STAGE 1: NLTK & COLLOCATES</b></h3>
    <ol type="1"> 
      <li>We will begin with an overview of NLTK and collocates and then split into groups based on interest. During the mini lesson, be sure to take notes in response to the following questions:</li>

        <ol type="a"> 
          <li>What is NLTK?</li>
          <li>What are some of the things we can do with NLTK?</li>
          <li>What are collocates? How are they identified and quantified?</li>
        </ol>

      <li>Next, we will split into two groups. Meera will facilitate one group for those interested in learning a little NLTK. Prof. Sanders Garcia will facilitate another group for those who would like to focus on the analysis of collocate data.</li>
        <ol type="a"> 
          <li><b>For those who are focusing on the analysis, you can download electronic lists of collocates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/AshleySanders/DigShakespeare/tree/master/Othello">DigShakespeare-Othello</a>.</b> If you haven't already installed the Chrome extension that makes it easy to download subdirectories (folders), here are the instructions: <a href="https://github.com/charany1/GHSDD">GitHub Easy Downloader Chrome Extension</a>.</li>

          <li><b>Choose 1-2 collocates lists to explore and respond to the questions in the Google Form below:</b></li>
          <br></br>

            <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAsnVcjWl1WAVFGCXGfOQTAWxwRt7yTXCV7TYdqFCIXI4t8g/viewform?embedded=true" width="800" height="800" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>
        </ol>
      <br></br>

      <li>Pair up or form small groups that include at least one participant from each of the two groups.</li> 

      <li>Share insights from the analysis you have already done with the collocates data and share any visualizations or additional data you created.</li>

      <li>Discuss the following questions:</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>What else can you add to the previous analyses of the collocates data?</li>
          <li>What additional information or insights do the visualizations reveal?</li>
          <li>When would using data visualizations be most useful? Word lists?</li>
        </ol>
      
      <li>Full-class report out</li>
    </ol>

  <h3><b>STAGE 2: Topic Modeling</b></h3>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Brief overview of Topic Modeling</li>
    <li>Explore the following two topic models and observe what the topic models reveal, the kinds of questions that can be answered with the models, and how the models differ.</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><a href="http://signsat40.signsjournal.org/topic-model/#/model/list">Topic model of 40 years of the journal <em>Signs</em></a></li>
        <li><a href="http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/Topics">Topic model of the historic Richmond newspaper the <em>Dispatch</em></a></li>
      </ol>
    <li>Review of text preprocessing</li> 
    <li>Explanation of necessary preprocessing for Shakespeare topic modeling workshop</li>
    <li>We will split into two groups once more. Meera will walk one group through using MALLET to create topic models of the collection of works we're studying this semester. Prof. Sanders Garcia will walk the other group through the use of a user-friendly topic modeling tool that has a graphical user interface.</li>
    <li>Each group should strive to complete these five steps:</li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Generate at least one model and explain the decisions made</li>
        <li>Visualize the model or at least some portion of it.</li>
        <li>Label the topics</li>
        <li>Write down any new insights and questions</li>
        <li>Predict what the remaining three works will be about based on your model.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
