  <h3><b>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</b></h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explain what preprocessing is, why it is important, and the options available.</li>
    <li>Explain what collocates are, how they are identified, and at least one way to score them.</li>
    <li>Use instructor-defined heuristic framework to analyze collocates from Othello.</li>
    <li>Extend analysis beyond a single character and beyond a single play.</li>
    <li>For NLTK gropu: Be able to modify Python script to identify and score collocates and explain how/why this modification might be useful <b>AND/OR</b> visualize collocate data using NumPy library.</li>
    <li>Explain what topic modeling is and some of the ways it may be used.</li>
    <li>Generate and use topic models to explore the collection of works we are studying this semester and make predictions about the works we have yet to read.</li>

  <h3><b>STAGE 1: NLTK & COLLOCATES</b></h3>
    <ol type="1"> 
      <li>What is NLTK?</li>
      <li>What are some of the things we can do with NLTK?</li>
      <li>What are collocates? How are they identified and quantified?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We will split into two groups for the next portion of class. Meera will facilitate one group for those interested in learning a little NLTK. Prof. Sanders Garcia will facilitate another group for those who would like to focus on the analysis of collocate data.</p>

    <p><b>For those who are focusing on the analysis, you can download electronic lists of collocates on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/AshleySanders/DigShakespeare/tree/master/Othello">DigShakespeare-Othello</a>. If you haven't already installed the Chrome extension that makes it easy to download subdirectories (folders), here are the instructions: https://github.com/charany1/GHSDD.
      
    
    <p>Choose 1-2 collocates lists to explore and respond to the following questions:</p>
