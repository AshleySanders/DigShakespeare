  <h3><b>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</b></h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explain what preprocessing is, why it is important, and the options available.</li>
    <li>Explain what collocates are, how they are identified, and at least one way to score them.</li>
    <li>Use instructor-defined heuristic framework to analyze collocates from Othello.</li>
    <li>Extend analysis beyond a single character and beyond a single play.</li>
    <li>For NLTK gropu: Be able to modify Python script to identify and score collocates and explain how/why this modification might be useful <b>AND/OR</b> visualize collocate data using NumPy library.</li>
    <li>Explain what topic modeling is and some of the ways it may be used.</li>
    <li>Generate and use topic models to explore the collection of works we are studying this semester and make predictions about the works we have yet to read.</li>

  <h3><b>STAGE 1: NLTK & COLLOCATES</b></h3>
    <ol type="1"> 
      <li>What is NLTK?</li>
      <li>What are some of the things we can do with NLTK?</li>
      <li>What are collocates? How are they identified and quantified?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We will split into two groups for the next portion of class. Meera will facilitate one group for those interested in learning a little NLTK. Prof. Sanders Garcia will facilitate another group for those who would like to focus on the analysis of collocate data.</p>

    <p><b>For those who are focusing on the analysis, you can download electronic lists of collocates at 

      <li><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/8fvfwqfdhgDq4mPW2">Complete prior knowledge assessment</a></li>
      <li>Download all the texts in the Hamlet folder for analysis from <a href="https://github.com/AshleySanders/DigShakespeare/tree/master/Hamlet">GitHub</a>. The first set of files we will analyze are Hamlet's soliloquies, which are labeled as follows: [Act #][Scene #]HamSol.txt. Then answer the following questions in small groups:</li>
        <ol type="a"> 
        <li>What do you notice about the composition of the documents?</li>
        <li>Why might the text have been prepared in this way?</li>
        <li>What kinds of questions might you be able to ask and answer given this partitioning of the play?</li>
        <li>How else could the play be partitioned?</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Open a browser window and navigate to <a href="http://voyant-tools.org">Voyant Tools</a></li>
      <li>Upload Hamlet's 7 soliloquies.</li>
      </ol>
      
  <h3><b>STAGE 2</b></h3>
    
      <p>Choose 1-2 collocates lists to explore and respond to the following questions:</p>

      <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAsnVcjWl1WAVFGCXGfOQTAWxwRt7yTXCV7TYdqFCIXI4t8g/viewform?embedded=true" width="800" height="800" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>
      

   <h3><b>STAGE 3</b></h3>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Compare insights from the soliloquies with an analysis of the play, split into scenes.</li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>You can either download the scenes from github and upload them into Voyant or just go straight to the pre-loaded <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=7b8d5168789e650ebbc9329af40810ad">corpus of scenes</a></li>
          <li>How does removing character names change your interpretation? Do different things stand out?</li>
          <li>Which words are most indicative of important moments in the plot and turning points? How did you decide?</li>
          <li>Which tools might be used to identify these words and moments?</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Write 2 paragraphs that summarize what text analysis has revealed about Hamlet's soliloquies and about the play, more generally?</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the 2 paragraphs, please include any questions you have about text analysis at this point or specific methods/tools you would like to explore.</li>
