  <h3><b>ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS</b></h3>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>What do Hamlet's soliloquies tell us about the plot?</li>
    <li>What do they tell us about Hamlet's character?</li>
    <li>What might they tell us about readers' sense of connection with this character? How does this compare with the ways in which readers are led to interpret Laertes, Horatio, and Ophelia, among others?</li>
    <li>How might we use text analysis to explore issues of gender, power, and agency?</li>
  </ol>

        </ol>
        <li>Next take a look at the <a href="http://voyant-tools.org/?bins=7&view=Trends&corpus=daaa71e1acbe221ad2ea67a0e66cba63">Trends tool</a></li>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>How were these words chosen for inclusion in Trends?</li>
            <li>What kind of information do the trend lines, x- and y- axes convey?</li>

    </ol>

   <h3><b>STAGE 3</b></h3>
    <ol type="1">
