Though this island seem to be desert,--
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
Yet,--
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
temperance.
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
Carthage?
Follow, I pray you.
