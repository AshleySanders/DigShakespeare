When consider The importancy Cyprus Turk, And let understand, That concerns Turk Rhodes, So may facile question bear it, For stands warlike brace, But altogether lacks abilities That Rhodes dress'd, in: make thought this, We must think Turk unskilful To leave latest concerns first, Neglecting attempt ease gain, To wake wage danger profitless.

Good grace, pardon me; Neither place aught I, heard business Hath raised bed, doth general care Take hold me, particular grief Is flood-gate oerbearing, nature That engluts swallows sorrows And still itself. 'VENICE Why, what's, matter? My daughter! 'O, daughter! 'VENICE\xc2\xa0Senator Dead? Ay, me; She abused, stol'n, me, corrupted By spells medicines bought mountebanks; For nature preposterously err, Being deficient, blind, lame sense, Sans witchcraft could not.

Here man, Moor, now, seems, Your special mandate state-affairs Hath hither brought. 'VENICE\xc2\xa0Senator We sorry for't., 'VENICE '[To 'OTHELLO] What, part, say this? Nothing, so. Most potent, grave, reverend signiors, My noble approved good masters, That I, taen, away old man's, daughter, It true; true, I, married her: The head front offending Hath extent, more. Rude I, speech, And little bless'd, soft phrase peace: For since arms mine seven years pith, Till nine moons wasted, used Their dearest action tented field, And little great world I, speak, More pertains feats broil battle, And therefore little shall I, grace cause In speaking myself. Yet, gracious patience, I, round unvarnish'd, tale deliver Of whole course love; drugs, charms, What conjuration mighty magic, For proceeding I, charged withal, I, daughter. A, maiden never bold; Of spirit still quiet, motion Blush'd, herself; she, spite nature, Of years, country, credit, every thing, To fall love fear'd, look on! It judgment maim'd, imperfect That confess perfection could err Against rules nature, must driven To find practises cunning hell, Why be. I, therefore vouch That mixtures powerful oer, blood, Or dram conjured effect, He wrought upon her. 'VENICE To vouch this, proof, Without wider overt test Than thin habits poor likelihoods Of modern seeming prefer him. First Senator But, Othello, speak: Did indirect forced courses Subdue poison young maid's, affections? Or came request fair question As soul soul affordeth? I, beseech you, Send lady Sagittary, And let speak father: If find foul report, The trust, office I, hold you, Not take away, let sentence Even fall upon life. 'VENICE Fetch Desdemona hither. Ancient, conduct them: best know place. Exeunt Attendants And, till come, truly heaven I, confess vices blood, So justly grave ears Ill, present How I, thrive fair lady's, love, And mine. 'VENICE Say it, Othello. Her father loved me; oft invited me; Still question'd, story life, From year year, battles, sieges, fortunes, That I, passed. I, ran through, even boyish days, To moment bade tell it; Wherein I, spake disastrous chances, Of moving accidents flood field Of hair-breadth scapes i imminent deadly breach, Of taken insolent foe And sold slavery, redemption thence And portance travels history: Wherein antres vast deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks hills whose heads touch heaven It hint speak,--such process; And Cannibals eat, The Anthropophagi men whose heads Do grow beneath shoulders. This hear Would Desdemona seriously incline: But still house-affairs would draw thence: Which ever could haste dispatch, Sheld, come again, greedy ear Devour discourse: I, observing, Took pliant hour, found good means To draw prayer earnest heart That I, would pilgrimage dilate, Whereof parcels something heard, But intentively: I, consent, And often beguile tears, When I, speak distressful stroke That youth suffer'd., My story done, She gave pains world sighs: She swore, faith, twas strange, twas, passing strange, Twas, pitiful, twas, wondrous pitiful: She wish'd, heard it, yet wish'd, That heaven made man: thank'd, me, And bade me, I, friend loved her, I, teach tell story. And would woo her. Upon hint I, spake: She loved dangers I, pass'd,, And I, loved pity them. This witchcraft I, used: Here comes lady; let witness it. Enter 'DESDEMONA, 'IAGO, Attendants 'VENICE I, think tale would win daughter too. Good Brabantio, Take mangled matter best: Men broken weapons rather use Than bare hands. I, pray you, hear speak: If confess half wooer, Destruction head, bad blame Light man! Come hither, gentle mistress: Do perceive noble company Where owe obedience? My noble father, I, perceive divided duty: To I, bound life education; My life education learn How respect you; lord duty; I, hitherto daughter: here's, husband, And much duty mother show'd, To you, preferring father, So much I, challenge I, may profess Due Moor lord. God wi you! I, done. Please grace, state-affairs: I, rather adopt child get it. Come hither, Moor: I, give thee heart Which, thou hast already, heart I, would keep thee. For sake, jewel, I, glad soul I, child: For thy escape would teach tyranny, To hang clogs them. I, done, lord. 'VENICE Let speak like yourself, lay sentence, Which, grise step, may help lovers Into favour. When remedies past, griefs ended By seeing worst, late hopes depended. To mourn mischief past gone Is next way draw new mischief on. What cannot preserved fortune takes Patience injury mockery makes. The robb'd, smiles steals something thief; He robs spends bootless grief. So let Turk Cyprus us beguile; We lose not, long smile. He bears sentence well nothing bears But free comfort thence hears, But bears sentence sorrow That, pay grief, must poor patience borrow. These sentences, sugar, gall, Being strong sides, equivocal: But words words; I, never yet hear That bruised heart pierced ear. I, humbly beseech you, proceed affairs state. 'VENICE The Turk mighty preparation makes Cyprus. Othello, fortitude place best known you; though substitute allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, sovereign mistress effects, throws safer voice you: must therefore content slubber gloss new fortunes stubborn boisterous expedition. The tyrant custom, grave senators, Hath made flinty steel couch war My thrice-driven bed down: I, agnise A, natural prompt alacrity I, find hardness, undertake These present wars Ottomites. Most humbly therefore bending state, I, crave fit disposition wife. Due reference place exhibition, With accommodation besort As levels breeding. 'VENICE If please, Be't, father's., Ill, so. Nor 'I. Nor 'I; I, would reside, To put father impatient thoughts By eye. Most gracious duke, To unfolding lend prosperous ear; And let find charter voice, To assist simpleness. 'VENICE What would You, Desdemona? That I, love Moor live him, My downright violence storm fortunes May trumpet world: heart's, subdued Even quality lord: I, saw Othello's, visage mind, And honour valiant parts Did I, soul fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, I, left behind, A, moth peace, go war, The rites I, love bereft me, And I, heavy interim shall support By dear absence. Let go him. Let voices. Vouch me, heaven, I, therefore beg not, To please palate appetite, Nor comply heat--the young affects In defunct--and proper satisfaction. But free bounteous mind: And heaven defend good souls, think I, serious great business scant For me: no, light-wing'd, toys Of feather'd, Cupid seal wanton dullness My speculative officed instruments, That disports corrupt taint business, Let housewives make skillet helm, And indign base adversities Make head estimation! 'VENICE Be shall privately determine, Either stay going: affair cries haste, And speed must answer it. First Senator You must away to-night. With heart. 'VENICE At nine i morning well, meet again. Othello, leave officer behind, And shall commission bring you; With things else quality respect As doth import you. So please grace, ancient; A, man honest trust: To conveyance I, assign wife, With else needful good grace shall think To sent me. 'VENICE Let so. Good night every one. To And, noble signior, If virtue delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law far fair black. First Senator Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well. Look her, Moor, thou hast eyes see: She deceived father, may thee. Exeunt 'VENICE, Senators, Officers, '& 'c My life upon faith! Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I, leave thee: I, prithee, let thy wife attend her: And bring best advantage. Come, Desdemona: I, hour Of love, worldly matters direction, To spend thee: must obey time. Exeunt Iago,-- What sayst, thou, noble heart? What I, do, thinkest thou? Why, go bed, sleep. I, incontinently drown myself. If thou dost, I, shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman! It silliness live live torment; prescription die death physician. O, villainous! I, looked upon world four times seven years; since I, could distinguish betwixt benefit injury, I, never found man knew love himself. Ere I, would say, I, would drown love guinea-hen, I, would change humanity baboon. What I, do? I, confess shame fond; virtue amend it. Virtue! fig! tis, thus thus. Our bodies gardens, wills gardeners: plant nettles, sow lettuce, set hyssop weed thyme, supply one gender herbs, distract many, either sterile idleness, manured industry, why, power corrigible authority lies wills. If balance lives one scale reason poise another sensuality, blood baseness natures would conduct us preposterous conclusions: reason cool raging motions, carnal stings, unbitted lusts, whereof I, take call love sect scion. It cannot be. It merely lust blood permission will. Come, man. Drown thyself! drown cats blind puppies. I, professed thy friend I, confess knit thy deserving cables perdurable toughness; I, could never better stead thee now. Put money thy purse; follow thou wars; defeat thy favour usurped beard; I, say, put money thy purse. It cannot Desdemona long continue love Moor,-- put money thy purse,--nor her: violent commencement, thou shalt see answerable sequestration:--put money thy purse. These Moors changeable wills: fill thy purse money:--the food luscious locusts, shall shortly bitter coloquintida. She must change youth: sated body, find error choice: must change, must: therefore put money thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, delicate way drowning. Make money thou canst: sanctimony frail vow betwixt erring barbarian supersubtle Venetian hard wits tribe hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A, pox drowning thyself! clean way: seek thou rather hanged compassing thy joy drowned go without her. Wilt thou fast hopes, I, depend issue? Thou art sure me:--go, make money:--I told thee often, I, re-tell thee again, I, hate Moor: cause hearted; thine hath less reason. Let us conjunctive revenge him: thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself pleasure, sport. There many events womb time delivered. Traverse! go, provide thy money. We to-morrow. Adieu. Where shall meet i morning? At lodging. Ill, thee betimes. Go to; farewell. Do hear, Roderigo? What say you? No drowning, hear? I, changed: Ill, go sell land. Exit Thus I, ever make fool purse: For I, mine gain'd, knowledge profane, If I, would time expend snipe. But sport profit. I, hate Moor: And thought abroad, twixt, sheets He done office: I, know if't, true; But 'I, mere suspicion kind, Will surety. He holds well; The better shall purpose work him. Cassio's, proper man: let see now: To get place plume In double knavery--How, how? Let's, see:-- After time, abuse Othello's, ear That familiar wife. He hath person smooth dispose To suspected, framed make women false. The Moor free open nature, That thinks men honest seem so, And tenderly led nose As asses are.

And yet, nature erring itself,-- Ay, there's, point: as--to bold you-- Not affect many proposed matches Of clime, complexion, degree, Whereto see things nature tends-- Foh! one may smell rank, Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural. But pardon me; I, position Distinctly speak her; though I, may fear Her will, recoiling better judgment, May fall match country forms And happily repent. Farewell, farewell: If thou dost perceive, let know more; Set thy wife observe: leave me, Iago: '[Going] My lord, I, take leave. Why I, marry? This honest creature doubtless Sees knows more, much more, unfolds.
