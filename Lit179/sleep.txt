The ceremony is almost over.
This way, please.
- Have the Dairyu executives arrived?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the hall?
Over there,
in the reception area.
In front of the screen,
by the pine tree.
- We want to see them immediately.
- Just for a minute.
So we don't disturb the banquet.
<i>Excuse me.</i>
Please make way
for the bride and groom.
- The banquet's about to begin.
- Quick!
A police detective!
What's all this about?
Why cover the wedding
of the daughter
of Public Corporation's
vice president?
- Don't play dumb. They're both here.
- Who is?
You searched Dairyu
and nabbed their accountant.
- Is the president or director next?
- Or both?
Excuse me.
Get a shot of them busting him.
Wada, get back to your seat.
I can't run the party without you.
Sir...
the party program
is outlined here.
- Who is that?
- Someone from Dairyu?
No, he's with Public Corp.
That's Wada,
assistant chief of contracts.
That's Wada, right?
Hello. News desk?
Here's a twist: An arrest
in Public Corp. 's contracts division.
The Public Corporation
for Land Development.
That's right: Assistant chief
of contracts at Public Corp.
This is bigger than just
embezzlement at Dairyu Construction.
It's obviously a kickback scheme
between Dairyu and Public Corp.
Yes, I'll stay on the story.
Now that the ceremony
is duly completed,
we will commence
the wedding feast.
I, Shirai, chief of contracts
for Public Corporation,
hereby undertake to serve, however
poorly, as master of ceremonies.
First, our president, Arimura,
who acted as matchmaker,
will present
the bride and groom.
Please allow me to present
the couple.
The bridegroom, Koichi Nishi,
who stands here beside me,
hardly needs me
to enumerate the skills
he has displayed
as Vice President Iwabuchi's secretary.
He only became secretary
after his engagement.
I just heard that
at the reception desk.
Nishi, who lost his family
to the war...
What did this Nishi do before?
Unclear.
He's a pal of Iwabuchi's son.
What's the son do?
Nothing.
The infamous prodigal son.
He's the one who shocked everyone
by catching the bride before she fell.
Nishi's future prospects
glow brightly indeed.
As for his lovely bride, Yoshiko,
she is a talented alumna
of Keitoku Girls School
and is not only exquisite,
but also a rare paragon
of unsullied innocence.
There's a senryu verse that goes:
"The bride is beautiful -
that is, with dowry in hand. "
Don't be so cruel.
The groom is the cruel one.
He only married her
to guarantee his own success.
On this most auspicious of days...
Auspicious indeed!
- And him?
- Moriyama, top administrator.
As great as the joy
of both families must already be,
we, the employees
of Public Corporation,
extend to them
our most sincere congratulations.
For it is now three years
since our corporation first...
Who's that?
Iwabuchi, vice president.
An assistant chief in contracts,
his boss, the administrator,
and the vice president.
It all adds up.
Iwabuchi-san,
the new father-in-law...
Wait.
It's all coming back now.
Five years ago, that illegal bid
on government construction.
An assistant, Furuya,
jumped from a seventh-story window,
but they covered it up.
Back then,
Iwabuchi was division head,
with Moriyama and Shirai
under him.
The "Clean-Up Trio" of graft.
Then they all landed equivalent
positions at Public Corp...
Nice little racket
they've got going.
Now Moriyama-san
will propose
a toast to the newlyweds.
I'm actually among you today
to stand in
for the groom's father.
Someone more appropriate
should propose the toast.
Enough formalities.
Get on with your toast.
Yes.
Hardly the time
for him to be making a toast.
If it's not too presumptuous,
I'll toast to the bride
and groom's future.
Cheers!
- Congratulations.
Another arrest?
Hey, he's with Dairyu Construction.
Did the police let him go?
Now let's take congratulations
from our assembled guests.
First, Hatano-san,
president of Dairyu Construction.
As you've been told,
I am Hatano
of Dairyu Construction.
Today we sit
among distinguished guests
from political, government
and business circles.
I am insignificant
in comparison.
To be accorded
the unexpected honor of speaking first
leaves me dumbfounded.
He's really sweating his way
through this one.
As for our relationship
with Public Corporation,
Public found our fair and upright
approach to business
compatible with their own
founding principles.
We've set aside profits
in the interest of long-term goals
and cooperated to achieve
our present success.
The thing is,
what I'd most like to say is
I have no personal ties
to Public Corp.
Some toast.
Like he's pleading his case
to the prosecutor.
It's difficult to find the right words,
but I offer my most sincere
congratulations.
May the bride and groom
forge a strong marital bond
and find great happiness together.
These are my congratulations,
brief though they may be.
Next, the bridegroom's friend
will speak
on behalf of his circle.
He is also the bride's brother.
Tatsuo Iwabuchi will now offer
congratulatory remarks.
Traditionally,
in making a wedding toast,
we stick to the same old
sugarcoated clichés.
Frankly, my father isn't
crazy about aspects of Nishi's past
outlined in
a detective agency's report.
But then it's not my father
who's getting married.
My father has to accept
that Yoshiko's in love with him.
Fact is, I love Nishi too.
We became friends
a year and a half ago
when I bought a used sports car
from his tiny car dealership.
Since then, I've learned that
Nishi has a rare sense of justice.
Rumors are flying
about this wedding,
about Nishi
using my sister's disability
to boost himself up
the corporate ladder.
But I swear it can't be true.
I'm firmly convinced of that.
Hey, Nishi.
I'm counting on you
to look after my sister.
She's had a tough life.
I may be a mess,
but I'd do anything to protect her.
Listen, Nishi.
If you make my sister unhappy,
I swear I'll kill you!
A bit unconventional perhaps,
but a great speech,
brimming with passion.
Now it's time
for the bride and groom
to cut the wedding cake.
Yet another cake.
That's a strange one.
Must be a business gift.
Hey, looks like
that ministry building.
Look, there's a rose
on the seventh floor.
That's the window
that guy jumped from.
What is it, Shirai?
Get on with it!
Yes... yes.
Allow me to replace that.
Helluva wedding.
Truly bizarre.
Best one-act I've ever seen.
One-act?
This is just the prelude.

PROSECUTOR RUNNING OUT OF TIME
Wada-san,
who on earth have you been protecting
with your three weeks of silence?
You work for Public Corporation.
Like any government official, you have
a duty to serve the public interest.
The 
for construction costs
were taxes the public paid
with their sweat and blood.
Legitimate expenses
are one thing.
But there's no question
that the bidding was rigged.
All the other bids came
in between 8.5 and nine billion.
Only Dairyu's 
what Public Corp. Had estimated.
It fit like a glove.
Three billion higher
than the others.
On top of that,
you required all the bidders
to submit complete
itemized budgets immediately.
If they couldn't,
you rejected them as unprofessional.
You handed that job
to Dairyu on a silver platter.
This is an outrage!
A reckless waste
of the public's hard-earned money!
You owe it to the public to reveal
everything you know.
You're in charge
of Public Corp. 's contracts.
No bidding scheme could have
proceeded without your participation.
You're an expert in budgeting.
Bidders want that information badly.
I'll make an educated guess
and say
the idea to demand itemized
budgets from Dairyu's competitors
could only have come
from an old business hand like you.
We're both a bit tired.
By the way, don't you live
over in Zoshigaya?
I ran across this.
A receipt from the Hatsufune
Restaurant's regular taxi company.
Of course the date, destination
and time are all here.
"October 7, from Hatsufune
to Zoshigaya. "
And another fare
on the same date to Kamimachi.
Isn't that where your boss lives?
Then, on the same day,
a fare to Nishiogikubo.
That's Moriyama's
neighborhood, isn't it?
And this one to Shibuya,
where Vice President Iwabuchi lives.
Wada-san,
what am I to make of all this?
Hatsufune's books indicate
Dairyu covered it all.
Sticking with your silence?
Look at this stack of receipts
from other days.
PROSECUTOR NONAKA
Yes?
Special delivery.
Anonymous.
Something else
from our informer.
"Look at taxi receipts
from Hatsufune's regular company. "
Incredible.
One step behind us,
but right on track.
Who could it be?
The tips are always right on target.
Most informers are rivals
using slander for revenge.
This seems different.
Maybe it's from the same person
the reporters mentioned
who pulled off
that wedding cake stunt.
No clue who sent
that cake, right?
No, all we've got
is the name of the bakery,
an order describing the design,
its destination, the date,
and the alarming amount of cash
delivered to pay for it.
Come in.
Still nothing?
He seemed like the perfect way to get
to the Iwabuchi-Moriyama-Shirai clique.
How about Miura?
What'll we do?
We can't keep holding them.
We'll let Wada go.
And Miura?
Switch his charge to embezzlement
and squeeze him harder.
We've discovered 
in undocumented payments
on Dairyu's books.
Miura in accounting
can't explain them.
Clear grounds
for embezzlement charges.
If they were bribes, he could claim
they were development costs
and eventually
return to the business.
But if he lined his own pockets
with company funds,
he'll never work again.
If we charge him
with embezzlement, he'll talk.
So release him and then -
Releasing him and arresting him again
is a dirty trick,
but his tactics are even dirtier.
TOKYO DETENTION CENTER
That must have been an ordeal.
Miura-san,
another warrant for you.
I'm his lawyer.
Embezzlement?
Before I came to meet you,
the president,
the other top executives,
and I anticipated
this very eventuality.
The president said
that if it were to happen,
I should give you
the following message.
He was quite adamant about it.
He said, "I know you'll see this through
to the bitter end. "
Stop!
Prosecutor, any comment
on Miura's suicide?
Your statement
was short on detail.
- Did Miura really kill himself?
- He did.
Prosecutor,
isn't this an advance
in the art of murder?
That message the president sent
with his lawyer
right before Miura's suicide -
"I know you'll see this through
to the bitter end" -
might as well have been
a bullet from a high-powered rifle.
This was, in fact,
an assassination.
This was - in fact -
nothing but a suicide.
Just a minute.
Aren't you concerned
Wada will be next?
After his release,
Wada met with Moriyama and Shirai.
He has yet to return home.
Can you confirm that he's safe?
Any word of his whereabouts?
We're conducting
a thorough investigation.
IN CONFERENCE
PUBLIC CORPORATION
FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
SITE THREE
Forgive me.
I'll do it right now.
You've become
a real lapdog, haven't you?
You'd kill yourself just because
Moriyama and Shirai told you to.
Those masters you so loyally serve
are celebrating even now.
To Iwabuchi, Moriyama and Shirai,
you're just a nuisance,
a walking liability
they want to be rid of.
But listen to me:
Cattle and swine die kinder deaths!
I don't understand. How can you say
such things when you're -
When I'm Iwabuchi's son-in-law?
What'll it be?
You wanna die?
WADA OF PUBLIC CORPORATION
COMMITS SUICIDE
DO SUICIDES PROVE CORRUPTION?
A SECOND VICTIM,
FAST ON MIURA'S HEELS
UNDERLINGS SACRIFICE
THEMSELVES TO CONTAIN SCANDAL
PUBLIC CORPORATION
FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT
What are your thoughts
on Wada's suicide?
I grieve for him deeply.
Is that all?
First we had Miura's suicide,
followed by Wada's.
Fairly convenient developments
for Dairyu and Public Corporation.
What does that mean?
This way the bribery investigation
goes up in smoke,
just like five years ago
with the ministry building contract.
Don't let your imagination
run away with you, my friend.
Your statements are groundless.
You think so?
The public isn't so sure.
They wonder if those two
really had to die.
You're barking up the wrong tree...
with these questions.
Miura killed himself
after three weeks of interrogation
when they released him,
only to serve him
with another warrant.
As for Wada,
I gather he was an earnest man
with a meek personality.
An innocent man
accused of dishonesty,
on the verge of a breakdown
when he was released.
What drove these two men
to their deaths?
Why don't you ask
the prosecutor's office for the truth?
N. I. AUTO SALES AND SERVICE
Yes, a Chrysler.
No, a New Yorker won't do.
Has to be an Imperial.
Black exterior, gray interior.
Got that?
You should eat something.
What kind of person is Nishi?
Given his relationship
to the vice president, I just don't -
Why did he save me?
I mean, what did he accomplish?
Please tell me.
Just what kind of person is he?
And what kind of person are you?
What's your relationship to him?
My relationship with Nishi?
It's very complex
and mysterious.
Time to go.
- Where?
- Your funeral.
I just dropped off an offering
on behalf of Iwabuchi and the firm.
They've put on quite a show.
A five-tier altar, three priests,
and two huge wreaths
courtesy of Public Corp.
A beautiful funeral.
I knew it.
And here you are -
Dairyu would've liked
to send flowers in celebration,
but that would've been
a bit obvious.
Why are you doing this to me?
This is sheer torment.
I'd rather be dead.
Please, let me die.
I have to die.
Wasting this fine funeral -
Calm down, now.
There's something
I want you to hear.
You've been to Noir, right?
The bar run
by Moriyama's mistress?
This is Moriyama and Shirai
talking there last night.
<i>What, you come
to this kind of place?</i>
<i>And so soon
after getting married?</i>
<i>You've caught me red-handed.</i>
<i>I'm ready for a dance.</i>
<i>Now, now.
No need to rush off.</i>
That's when I placed a briefcase
with this tape recorder inside it
under their table.
I'll play their conversation for you
after they arrive for the funeral.
Public Corp. 's official car.
Chief Shirai!
Moriyama!
<i>Man, oh, man,
what a relief.</i>
<i>You were born
with a gift for persuasion.</i>
<i>That sounds awful.</i>
<i>Look who's talking.</i>
<i>You left him no choice but suicide.</i>
<i>Cut it out.
No need to spell it out like that.</i>
<i>Let's drink
and enjoy ourselves tonight.</i>
<i>Still, it all leaves a bad taste
in my mouth somehow.</i>
<i>Get yourself a young girl,
the best remedy for a day like today.</i>
Wada,
still ready to die for them
and let them go scot-free?
Don't you want revenge?
- Revenge?
- That's right. You and me together.
Drinking so early?
Did you see the papers?
Makes me feel like crap.
A drunk needs
no excuse to drink.
I wish I had
your blind faith in Dad.
What the papers hint at
can't be true.
Our father couldn't possibly -
He's been a good father to you. Loved
you enough for two after Mom died.
Is he a bad father to you?
No, he's a good father to me too,
which is why
this drives me so crazy.
Let's drop the subject.
A baby like you can only trust blindly.
I'm not a baby.
Oh, excuse me.
Lady of the house, is it?
What's wrong?
Are you happy?
Does Nishi... love you?
You sure?
Yes. Why do you ask?
If he loves you,
that's all that matters.
The prosecution seems to have let up,
and the matter's closed.
I'm sorry for allowing this
to cause you such concern.
Who? The president?
I'll give the old man
a vague report at some point.
No doubt he'll hold forth
about earnest principles and such.
I trust you'll be able
to handle him.
Yes, thank you.
Now if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Isn't it time you took off
that mourning band?
And you should knock
before entering,
even if you are
a member of the family.
That's all for today.
Make a left here.
MITSUl STORAGE
It's ready, sir.
Follow me.
- This is all very mysterious.
- Yes, I -
Just who do you think stole
that five million yen in cash
from the safe-deposit box
in the vault?
When I found that postcard
in the box,
I assumed it was probably
the same person
who sent that cake
to the wedding banquet.
That cake had to be
from one of the losing bidders.
But how could they get to the vault?
Only you and Wada knew of it.
That's just it. We set up two -
no, three levels of security
to protect that deposit box.
And those were?
The key and seal to enter the vault
are in a suitcase in storage.
But you need my regular office seal
to access the storage room.
And here's the key to the suitcase.
I keep them both
in my unlocked desk drawer.
It seemed safer than acting
as if I had something to hide.
The seal and key
are useless anyway
unless you know
about the suitcase in storage.
An ingenious plan.
Thank you.
The thing is,
the complexity of the plan
only implicates you more deeply.
Only you and Wada knew
the whole setup.
Take away Wada
and that leaves you.
No wonder Moriyama
is suspicious of you.
But I - I would never -
Calm down.
But -
By the way, do you still have the key
and seal for the deposit box?
Yes.
Hand them over.
It's hardly a huge sum,
but Moriyama should still investigate.
What's wrong?
Don't you have them?
No, it's just -
I thought -
In my briefcase -
In your secretary's office.
Nishi speaking.
<i>- Bring in Shirai's briefcase.
- No, I'll get it myself.</i>
Thank you.
Just what are you doing?
Aren't the key and seal
in your briefcase either?
No, it's not that.
Then show them to me.
Why won't you open it?
Seems there's something in there
you don't want me to see.
Let's have a look.
I said open it!
I have no idea...
how that got in my briefcase.
That's enough.
Come with me.
I don't have any -
Just follow me!
<i>Sir, we're in Kamimachi now.
Which house is yours?</i>
<i>Sir?</i>
Sir, this is Kamimachi Block 2.
Sir.
Sir...
that's 
Your change.
Wada!
You expect me to believe
that Wada's alive
and that he took the money?
Ridiculous!
Don't say that. It's true.
I saw him with my own eyes.
Enough of your excuses.
Wada!
Our work is done for tonight.
Isn't it fun playing a ghost?
What's wrong?
You saw him, didn't you?
Shirai's face.
Why should you care?
Aren't you happy to see him suffer?
What's the matter?
It's the middle of the night.
Oh, it's Shirai-san.
See that he gets home.
I swear, I saw Wada
with my own eyes.
I swear it.
Enough!
I wonder if Father's all right.
Forget Dad.
Worry about your husband.
I don't know what Nishi's up to.
He's out late every night.
He came home early last night.
Oh, you're home.
It's late.
Had to go out with the boys.
Did you go to Noir?
Yeah, something like that.
I was there all evening.
Listen, Nishi.
Yoshiko, please get some more ice.
- You're going to drink more?
I'll start a new round with Nishi.
Bring me that ice.
Hey.
Why do you two sleep
in separate rooms?
The project I'm working on
keeps me out till all hours.
I'd hate to wake her
in the middle of the night.
What the hell are you up to?
The stakes must be awfully high.
It's written all over your face.
I know well enough
that being Dad's secretary
involves you in risky situations.
But listen, Nishi.
Don't risk your neck for him.
If only for Yoshiko's sake.
She's -
I feel such pity for her.
And I have only
my own stupidity to blame.
When she was just this small,
I took a fall on my bike
with her on the back.
It's my fault she's lame, Nishi.
She has to be happy.
I have to help her.
I'm begging you.
You've got to
make her happy. Please.
Yoshiko!
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
- No, I'm sorry. I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
Good night!
Good night.
So Shirai even hounded you
at home?
Do you think
my husband is still alive?
I'm terribly sorry.
I think you should
give up any such hope.
But Shirai-san says
he's definitely seen him.
He's hallucinating.
Your husband's death came
as a great shock to him.
He's suffered
a nervous breakdown.
Where's Chief Moriyama?
Shirai-san,
where's Chief Moriyama?
He's in the conference room.
Vice President Iwabuchi
wishes to see him.
Shirai? You mean,
he even went to you?
But I just can't -
Iwabuchi explained
what happened.
But there's no reason for Shirai
to swipe such a measly sum.
We've paid you more than amply.
Shirai needs a cut too.
This is nonsense! Of course
he's been rewarded handsomely.
Isn't that right?
- Yes.
A man with a full stomach
doesn't bother with snacks.
We've got to stick together.
Don't go too rough on Shirai.
Let me handle him.
You can't meddle
with our affairs at Public Corp.
But what if he gets desperate?
He might start blabbing
to the prosecutor.
Then you're done for.
That's your choice,
but don't drag us down with you.
This whole bidding scheme
was your idea.
You asked us to estimate
a nine-billion job at 
and kick back
the three billion to you.
We didn't like the idea one bit,
but we like doing business with you,
so we came on board.
But now you'd risk all our necks
for a measly five million.
We've had enough.
You say three billion,
but you've only kicked back half.
Ten percent is a standard kickback.
1.5 on 
- But our deal was -
- Listen, Iwabuchi.
You want a political career.
You're eyeing a ministry seat.
If you get it,
we'll reconsider our position.
I think we've made ourselves
absolutely clear.
Let's leave the Shirai problem
in Iwabuchi-san's hands.
Excuse us.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
They're rather full of themselves,
I have to say.
You're one to talk.
Are you sure
you've given Shirai his share?
Why, I would never -
Forget it.
Just do something about him.
- Meaning?
- Calm him down somehow.
Take him out to dinner
and apologize.
Apologize?
That's what it means to be on top!
He hardly looks
the part of a bad guy.
These are just about done.
It's too hot.
How's that?
Moriyama-san's on the phone.
I'll take it.
How are Nishi's
performance evaluations?
Just about perfect.
But he never seems to relax
and open up.
Yoshiko will loosen him up
a bit, right?
By the way, Father,
I have a request.
- I hope it isn't money.
- No, it's not that.
Give up your political ambitions
and retire as soon as
you're a grandfather.
You're the one who'd suffer,
forced to give up all your luxuries.
In that case, I'll get a job.
I'll believe that when I see it.
Moriyama-san wishes
to speak to you directly.
Hello? Yes, it's me.
What?
You leave me no choice.
I'll be there. Where are you?
What? Suminoya?
Are you crazy?
Why in the world
did you take him there?
Are you going out?
Shall I join you?
- No.
Where's Father?
He's gone out.
I'll be going out after dinner too.
Thank you for coming.
We'll call you if we need you.
I think it's what
they call paranoia.
What's wrong, Shirai?
Why don't you join us?
Come, now.
Do as our vice president says.
Let's have a toast.
Everything's exactly the same.
Just like it was...
five years ago.
That night Furuya sat there,
you were there, and I was there.
The conversation started
the same way.
"Let's have a toast. "
Don't make me laugh!
You can't talk me
into jumping out a window,
the way you did with Furuya.
Try that with me...
and I'll spill the whole story.
Shirai, calm down now.
We've invited you here
because our relationship with you
has been under some strain
and we'd like to improve it.
In a word,
we're here out of concern
for your state of mind.
The exact same words.
That's exactly how you backed
Furuya into a corner.
Wada too.
You know where Shirai lives?
Draw me a map.
You know the Kamimachi bus stop?
The bus stop is here.
You pass the next street
and turn at the second one.
Shirai's house is here.
Is it a quiet street?
Yes, especially at night.
It's 8:
See him home at 
and drop him off at this corner.
Two and a half hours
is plenty of time.
Plenty of time for what?
Do I need to spell it out?
Wada!
You Shirai?
Answer me.
You're Shirai, right?
<i>Get in.</i>
Where are you taking me?
Why have you brought me here?
I want to see you die here.
I knew it.
You're doing this
for the vice president.
You're wrong.
Iwabuchi hired a killer.
But you don't deserve
the favor of an assassin's bullet.
Recognize that window?
- Furuya!
- That's right.
Look at the hideous way he died:
His neck broken,
lying in a pool of his own blood.
The man who jumped from that window
five years ago was my father!
You find that shocking?
I'm Furuya's son.
That's a lie.
He had no children.
I was illegitimate.
My father hid
his relationship with my mother.
I can't believe it.
You're the vice president's -
It wasn't easy
leaping into a snake pit like this.
The real Koichi Nishi is elsewhere.
He and I exchanged identities.
For five years now,
I've lived only to avenge
my father's death.
I carry this picture
with me always.
The poor man.
The law couldn't
bring you to justice,
but I'll do it
with my own bare hands.
I'll start by making you
break your own damned neck.
Moriyama and I were just
following Iwabuchi's orders -
You forced my father
to kill himself.
No, I just -
The truth!
By threats or pleas
you convinced him
to kill himself, didn't you?
- No.
- Liar!
I arranged that cake
for my own wedding.
Your panic when it appeared
confirmed everything.
Was that...
what you intended...
for me too?
Forgive me!
Time to jump
and break your neck.
This drink's spiked with poison.
You hardly deserve the luxury,
but it'll be quick.
What'll it be?
Jump out the window?
Or swallow this, sitting in
the very chair my father sat in?
Wada,
you make him drink it.
You've certainly earned the right.
Please forgive him.
He has a wife and children too.
And what about you?
What about your family?
No, this is enough.
I forgive him.
Forgive?
How dare you! Who gave you
the right to forgive him?
You were in
on their crooked schemes.
So was my father.
They tamed my father and you
with scraps from their table
and offered you up as scapegoats,
yet you can't hate them.
This is the only message
scum like them understand.
Even now they sleep soundly,
grins on their faces.
I won't stand for it!
I can never hate them enough!
How can you be so brutal?
It's just whiskey.
The shock was too much for him.
He's lost his mind.
I had other plans for him,
but this'll do.
They'll find him this way
in the morning,
here on the seventh floor.
The papers will have a field day.
Watch Iwabuchi and Moriyama's
blood pressure spike.
Wada, have a drink.
Let's celebrate.
Not a single line.
They hushed it up.
That government office
tipped off Iwabuchi this morning.
Public Corp. 's
in bed with them too.
The bastards.
And to top it all off,
Moriyama and I had to go get Shirai.
We took him
to an insane asylum.
Acute schizophrenia triggered
by a profound shock.
That was his diagnosis.
Worst of all,
he keeps apologizing to Furuya.
Furuya?
"Furuya, forgive me,"
over and over.
It just doesn't make
any sense.
What was Shirai doing
in that seventh-floor office?
The door was locked
from the outside.
He'd never go there voluntarily.
Then who was it?
Sir...
maybe Shirai didn't steal
anything from the vault.
Maybe it was
that same unknown person.
Why?
When you think about it,
there's a common thread
running through these strange events.
The cake at the wedding,
the postcard inside the box,
the office where Shirai was found
and his inexplicable behavior.
They're all tied to Furuya,
which means that someone
is doing these things
in retaliation for Furuya's death.
That's my conclusion.
It makes sense in theory,
but who would do that for Furuya?
That's just it.
I believe his widow
was the only one to survive him.
Still, under the circumstances,
I'd better double-check on that.
I'm too soft.
I should have thrown Shirai
out that window.
If I had, the papers would be
all over Iwabuchi
and Moriyama by now.
I guess I don't
hate them enough.
Something's not quite right
about you.
You're going against your nature.
It's not easy hating evil.
You have to stoke your own fury
until you become evil yourself.
There's nothing wrong
with hating evil,
but you're sacrificing
innocent bystanders.
Yoshiko-san, for example.
You married her as a weapon.
What if she finds out
your real motive?
Shut up!
What are you shouting about?
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with Iwabuchi's daughter.
Hit the nail on the head, huh?
Unfortunately.
Nothing unfortunate about it.
It's an excellent development.
She may be your enemy's daughter,
but if you're in love, then love her.
It's childish to let that
get you all knotted up.
So the prosecutor's fallen in love
with the defendant's daughter.
Fine. Just don't get
hung up on it.
On our wedding night -
On our wedding night, we -
Well, given Yoshiko's condition,
we skipped the normal honeymoon
and spent the night
at Iwabuchi's house.
I was touched by how she waited
so innocently in our bedroom.
She lay there, rigid as a doll...
her face pale.
Her eyes were closed tight,
and she was trembling.
I realized I couldn't take
advantage of this girl.
Ever since -
You asshole!
That's worse than torturing her.
Hold on a minute.
I was wrong.
I've been torn in two ever since.
I've even had second thoughts.
So I've forced my own anger,
becoming more brutal than I needed to.
I want vengeance for my father,
but that's not all.
I want those villains
brought to justice
for the sake of all the helpless people
who don't even know they've been had.
Remember how driven I was
when I asked you to exchange identities?
Where's all that gone?
I make myself sick.
If you think you've gone wrong,
start over.
I don't need this anymore.
That's the spirit.
So now what?
It'd be great to blast apart
Moriyama, Iwabuchi
and the head honcho himself
in one fell swoop.
I'll use myself for dynamite.
The fact Iwabuchi sent me
to clean up after Shirai
proves he's begun
to really trust me.
If I sit tight and play my cards right,
I'll get to the bottom of their schemes.
And then - bang!
In the meantime, you might as well
love that bride of yours.
Make tonight
your real honeymoon.
Buy her a bouquet on me.
I must tell you,
Furuya has been constantly
in my thoughts lately.
And, of course,
I've been worried about you.
Thank you so much.
I manage to get along somehow.
But it can't be easy,
a single woman, managing
these apartments by yourself.
I don't remember Furuya
having any relatives
other than yourself.
The truth is,
I've never told you this before,
but my husband did have
a child who never lived with us.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to pry in any way.
Not at all.
Being alone like this at my age,
I long to meet him.
I'd even like him to live
with me if he would.
It was a boy.
Come to think of it,
he must be a man by now.
That part of my husband's life
happened long before
we got married.
And where are the woman
and her son now?
If only I knew.
In fact, I believe
the mother passed away,
so the son must be
all alone in the world.
Truly all alone.
Illegitimate -
is that the word?
Couldn't even use
my husband's name.
I hate to impose
on your kindness by asking this,
but couldn't you
somehow find the boy?
It would make me -
No, it would make Furuya so happy.
What was the woman's name?
Itakura.
I believe she went by Itakura.
Do you have
anything else to go on?
That's absolutely
everything I know.
I hated her so much, I couldn't
stand to know anything about her.
I never dreamed that time
would change my feelings this way.
Don't you even have
a picture of the boy?
You do?
These are pictures
from Furuya's funeral, so maybe -
Yes, this one, just as
the hearse was driving away.
This man is by himself,
away from the mourners,
standing behind
that telephone pole.
That face.
It looks so sad.
No, anguished.
He must have been a relative.
Do you think just maybe
he was Furuya's son?
I'd like a bouquet, please.
It's for a couple of newlyweds.
Where's Nishi?
Not home yet.
Cut it out, Father.
What do you mean?
Stop making Nishi
do your dirty work.
- I don't understand.
- Don't play dumb.
He's out late every night.
Last night it was 2:
2:
What the hell
are you making him do?
- Imagine how Yoshiko feels.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
And that fuss this morning,
sending him out
with Moriyama before dawn.
That's strange.
What can Nishi be up to?
What is it?
- Moriyama-san is here.
- Send him in.
You mean to say
Nishi is Furuya's son?
His real name's Itakura,
but there's no doubt at all.
Wait a minute.
He was out last night
until 2:
Just about the time
Shirai was found on the seventh floor.
It all fits perfectly.
Furuya's son is using
your daughter for revenge.
But his legal name is Nishi,
not Itakura.
<i>Itakura.</i>
Welcome home.
Don't move, damn it!
Tatsuo, what's wrong?
Out of the way, Yoshiko.
He's using you.
You're just a pawn
for his vengeance.
Stop!
You should've kept up the pretense.
We'd have handled it.
I intended to,
but as I've explained -
How did you, of all people, accept
such an absurd match for Yoshiko?
We conducted an investigation.
There was no cause
for suspicion of any kind.
What did he used to do?
He had a used-car dealership.
A broker, huh?
What became of the dealership?
He sold it
when he came to work for me.
That's the only thing
we have to go on.
Moriyama's already
checking on it.
Hello.
What is it?
It's Nishi.
Iwabuchi here.
What did he have to say?
- He's got Moriyama.
- What?
And Wada's still alive.
CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
Quit your whining.
You only have yourself to blame.
If you hadn't exposed my identity,
I'd never have treated you like this.
You just stumbled into our hands
at a critical moment.
- Kidnapping is a serious crime.
- That's right.
It's pointless trying to use
the law against evil people.
I've racked up plenty of crimes.
Identity fraud, matrimonial fraud,
unlawful detention.
Illegal entry, blackmail,
kidnapping.
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.
I can turn myself in
with my head held high.
Turn yourself in?
I'll lay it all out for you.
After you've spilled the beans,
I'll call a press conference.
A press conference?
I'll start
by introducing Wada.
"Wada of Public Corp. Found alive. "
Good headline.
Next I'll introduce myself.
"Iwabuchi's son-in-law
and secretary -
whose own father
was murdered five years ago -
uncovers massive corruption at
the Public Corp. For Land Development. "
And finally, you.
"Moriyama corroborates
evidence of corruption at Public Corp. "
Press coverage whips
public opinion into a frenzy.
I turn myself in
and cooperate with the authorities
at my leisure from the comfort of my cell.
- And if I refuse to talk?
- I'll make you!
And I play rough!
A forced confession isn't binding.
Think I don't know that?
But if I've got material evidence,
the prosecutor will accept it in the end.
Even Wada knows
Shirai pocketed seven million.
You probably got twice that,
at least 
Where's it all stashed?
In your position,
it'd take 
to set aside 
That sum alone
is material evidence of graft.
And another thing.
The day after they searched
Dairyu and arrested Wada,
you came flying into Iwabuchi's office,
your face all pale.
I could hear Iwabuchi raging at you,
"Can't you even handle this?"
You came out of his office stuffing
No doubt the kickbacks are divided
among all those accounts.
If we could track those down,
there'd be no better proof.
But Shirai just spilled the beans.
Liar. I'm the only one -
No one else knows?
Not even Iwabuchi?
Why, thank you. Now we've got
all our ducks in a nice neat row.
So of course Iwabuchi doesn't know
where you stashed your 
In other words,
as long as we've got you,
Iwabuchi can't touch
that valuable evidence.
So we'll just sit back and wait
until Moriyama here
decides to come clean.
Stop, you sons of bitches!
Hey, open up!
Open up!
Remember how shocked we were
when we crawled out
after the carpet-bombing?
The factory had been destroyed.
We were surrounded by a sea of flames.
I still have nightmares
about that hellish scene.
Me too.
But time sure flies.
It's already been 
since they yanked us out of high school
to man that factory.
Look at that smokestack.
You and I slugged it out
for real over there.
You were an arrogant asshole.
So were you.
- But once we started fighting -
- I wasn't such an asshole after all?
Remember our bicycle cart
without even a tire left?
Sure I do.
That cart was the only thing
that kept us fed after the war.
Wada, we used to haul industrial oil
out of here in that cart
to sell to the fancy villas.
It was gone in seconds.
We managed to make
that money grow.
Provisions brokers,
textile brokers, steel brokers.
With my family up north
wiped out in a naval bombardment
and this guy a bastard child,
we made a perfect team.
Although we never saw eye to eye
on going to college.
But your degree
sure came in handy.
Thanks to your name
and history,
I managed to marry
Iwabuchi's daughter.
This place brings back memories!
It was a mistake
for him to fall in love with her.
You really think so?
From her point of view,
if she knew he really loved her,
that she wasn't just being used,
that would at least
be some consolation.
I met the young lady twice
while planning the wedding.
She's a genuinely
sweet person.
When I think of her agony,
I wish a peaceful resolution
were possible.
Unfortunately
there just isn't any way.
Forget the daughter.
That man's evil.
If we hesitate, we're finished!
Are you trying to starve me?
Of course not.
We figured you'd be
too anxious to have an appetite.
Cut the crap!
You've starved me for two whole days.
- Would you eat?
- Of course.
We haven't got much to offer.
You like ham and eggs on toast?
Anything!
Ham and eggs on toast
will run you a cool 
Fifteen million?
Surely you're not shocked?
"Always get a kickback. "
That's your policy, isn't it?
Your share of the Dairyu kickbacks
came to 
Until you tell us where it's stashed,
no ham and eggs.
What's wrong?
I'm terrified.
If you keep this up,
where will it lead?
You're up against a terrifying system
that will never yield.
Having worked inside it for 
I know that in my guts.
Everyone feels that way and gives up.
That's how they get away with it.
Open up!
Hey, open the door!
Changed your mind?
Like hell!
I'll die before I tell you anything!
Then there's no point.
Seaweed canisters?
1,
would that be about this high?
Wrapped in plastic, sealed with tape,
stuffed in ceramic pots.
You greedy old codger.
Buried in the east corner
of the yard, under the holly tree.
You positive?
Under the holly tree?
Sounds like a fairy tale.
By the way,
do you have a dog?
We'll go check it out tonight.
What's the big idea,
leaving me locked up in here?
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
The bankbooks.
What became of those?
You'll stay until you tell us.
- That's absurd! I have no idea!
Nothing like a full belly.
Will there be
any special requests
for room service next time?
Goddamn you!
No matter how hard
you lean on him, he'll never talk.
You don't understand bureaucrats.
A good official
never implicates a superior,
no matter what the cost.
How touching.
So corruption continues unchecked, and
the fat cats brazenly steal public funds.
There's happily ever after for you.
Please don't be sarcastic.
It's hard on me too.
I'm losing my grip.
Who am I?
Am I alive or dead?
At least you've got
plans for the future.
- And you don't?
- I don't know anymore.
I know I'd like to see
my wife and daughter, but I can't.
Sure you can.
Get Moriyama to come clean
and you and I can turn ourselves in.
But who knows what'll happen if I do?
I can't do it.
Unmasking a superior -
it's impossible.
And what about Yoshiko-san?
She'll never understand.
If you expose her father,
she'll never forgive you.
Enough, you old fool!
You can't get to Nishi
with your sob stories.
He's not a petty bureaucrat like you.
He's gone.
Time to move out.
- Move out?
- Wada ran away.
Why would he do that?
He's no longer human,
a functionary.
An alien creature
molded by bureaucracy.
After everything he's been through,
he's still loyal.
See that?
Serves you right!
Quiet! The exertion
will only make you hungry!
Someone's coming!
You got your pistol?
No, I left it at Iwabuchi's.
Hey, I'm in here!
You realize what a serious risk
you just took?
I felt sorry
for Nishi-san and Yoshiko-san.
Liar!
Bringing in the woman
to sweet-talk him - a low tactic.
How'd you contact her?
By phone.
I coaxed her out,
then brought her here by cab.
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes, of course.
Wada, make another phone call.
This time
go straight to Iwabuchi.
I'll give you five -
no, ten million.
And that's not all.
I'll recommend you for Shirai's job
and throw in a promotion too.
I...
heard about everything
from Wada-san.
I'm...
so very happy.
Happier than you can imagine.
But my father -
Is he really
such a bad person?
Please, tell me the truth.
Tatsuo sometimes says
the same thing.
Is that really what Father is like?
So it's true, then.
But he's always been
a wonderful father to me.
Yoshiko!
Could you forgive my father
if I begged you to?
No, I'm sorry.
That's what Wada-san
wanted me to say.
But I could never ask that of you.
When I think of your father,
it's only natural
that you hate mine.
But I can't hate him myself.
What are we going to do?
Life is so ironic.
I don't just mean
our relationship.
My relationship
with my father too.
Let me tell you the story
of my father's life.
Even though he had
my mother and me,
he married someone his boss
suggested in order to get ahead.
That's the kind of man he was.
I didn't know I was illegitimate
until I applied to high school.
I always thought
my father was dead.
When I found out that the man
I'd known as my uncle was my father,
my whole world went black.
I never wanted to see him again,
so whenever he came to visit,
I would run away.
After my mother's death,
I wouldn't see him.
But then...
five years ago...
I don't even know
how he managed to find me,
but he suddenly turned up
at my place.
Later I realized
he wanted to make peace
with me before he died.
He kept apologizing,
his eyes full of tears.
I didn't know why he'd come.
I lashed out at him
and then stormed out.
The next day,
I read about his suicide
in the paper.
Then an envelope arrived.
Inside was a bankbook in my name.
The account held 1.5 million yen.
A lot of money
for someone in his position.
Probably kickbacks.
But now I'm overwhelmed
by how much he cared for me.
The more I regret
lashing out at him,
the more his words and gestures
I remember from my childhood
seem like signs
of his love for me.
My obsession with him
after his death
was as strong as my hatred for him
while he was alive.
That's what's driven me
to go this far.
I've used my inheritance
to finance this scheme.
It was the only thing
I could do with that money.
I'll go tell my father
that he must make amends
for all these sins.
I don't think
he's capable of that.
Then what can I do?
Yoshiko.
If you really want
your father to make amends,
let me take care of it.
It may seem unbearable
to allow me to expose his deeds,
but it's the only way
he'll ever make up for what he's done.
Yes.
As you say,
right now my hands are tied.
Yes, I understand that perfectly.
In the worst case,
I will take my own life.
I wouldn't think
of dragging you into this.
What?
It was kind of you
to have the drug delivered to me,
even going to the trouble
of indicating dosage.
I am much obliged.
The fact is, my nerves have been
getting the better of me.
Tonight,
thanks to your consideration,
I'll take a small dose
and sleep peacefully.
Hello?
Welcome home.
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?
Yoshiko never goes anywhere.
Where was she?
I don't know.
When did she leave?
After she got a phone call
just after noon.
Who was it?
I don't know.
The caller didn't give his name.
He simply asked
to speak to your daughter.
And Tatsuo?
He woke up at 2:
took his gun and went out.
He was wearing hunting clothes.
That'll be all.
Where's Nishi?
You'd better tell me. Tatsuo left
with his rifle, swearing he'd get Nishi.
Yoshiko, where's Nishi?
Didn't you go see him?
I'm afraid Tatsuo followed you
to track down Nishi.
If that's not it,
I don't know what to do next.
What on earth is Tatsuo planning?
This is just punishment
for all the harm I've done.
I should have resolved long ago
to turn myself in
and make amends.
If I had, this never would have -
I can't bear
to sit here like this.
Father, it's true.
I did go to see Nishi.
What? Really?
There's hope, then.
Where is he?
I'll go with you.
No, leave this to me.
You can barely stand.
No, I'm going with you.
Have some of this wine.
Drink it all, quickly.
Wait here
while I call for the car.
I need the car right away.
What's wrong?
You're in no condition to go out.
No, I'm -
Yoshiko, there's no time.
Leave this to me.
Where's Nishi?
Tell me now!
Where is he?
The ruins of that munitions factory...
in Musashihara.
I put your bride in a taxi.
We've got to get out of here.
Don't panic.
We'll leave first thing tomorrow.
So he finally talked, huh?
He says he left the bankbooks
in a safe at the Muraki Inn in Tsukuji.
The Muraki Inn?
Damn!
He's a sly old fox!
Let's go have a look.
The inn will be a breeze.
The holly thorns cut me up bad
while I dug for those pots
stuffed with cash.
After the inn,
it's straight to the papers.
Right. And after the press conference,
we all move into the pen.
That'll be the safest place.
I'm leaving the car.
Yoshiko.
What's going on?
Why are you sleeping here?
Tatsuo!
Nishi! Where's Nishi?
Did you see Father?
Dad?
You didn't see him!
Did you shoot Nishi?
What?
Are you still half asleep?
I just got these.
So you weren't out
looking for Nishi?
If I knew where that jerk was,
I'd beat the crap out of him.
Why would Father lie to me?
What did Dad do?
Tell me!
Tatsuo, what are you thinking?
What do you think has happened?
We'll know when we get there.
I'm so frightened.
I want to trust Father.
So do I.
It was you, wasn't it?
You told them where Nishi was.
Congratulations.
Thanks to you,
Nishi's been murdered.
Don't blame her.
Our father tricked her into telling.
Tricked her, did he?
Now all of Japan
can be tricked the same way.
You must've seen it
on your way here -
that car flattened into scrap
by a freight train.
Nishi was in that car!
You don't believe me?
I'll show you, then.
I'll show you
what they did to him.
Look.
The signs
of his last stand against them!
There's more.
Take a close look.
That bottle of alcohol
and the broken syringe.
I think -
No, I'm positive.
Nishi -
They pinned him down.
Then...
they shot him full of grain alcohol.
Then they dumped him
in the car I'd left as a precaution
and aimed him,
unconscious, toward the tracks.
Drunk driving.
His sense of justice
and all his hard work
will be consigned to oblivion
and his name dragged in the mud!
Yoshiko!
You're Tatsuo...
right?
I'm Itakura.
Actually, my real name's Nishi.
But now I can't ever
go back to being myself.
Listen to me.
The car Nishi died in was mine.
It was registered to Nishi.
So Nishi died in Nishi's car.
I'm Itakura now.
I can't testify to anything.
How could this happen?
Nishi was murdered last night -
that much is certain.
Yet even though it's a fact...
there's nothing I can do about it.
They killed Wada too.
Wada?
The assistant.
He was here last night,
but now he's gone.
He was already thought to be dead.
Easy enough to get rid of him.
And Moriyama, who spilled his guts
last night - they took him away too.
By now they've probably destroyed
all material evidence.
I know everything.
It's horrifying that it's all so simple
and yet so foul!
But I don't have
a single shred of evidence.
There's nothing I can say,
nothing I can do!
Goddamn it!
How can this be?
How can this be?
Apparently they found
high levels of alcohol in his blood.
I find that impossible to believe.
Not Nishi.
As far as I'm concerned,
he was irreplaceable.
And it's not nepotism
that makes me laud
his ability and effectiveness.
He was the perfect secretary.
And I've lost not only a model employee,
but a son-in-law too.
I can only say that I'm stunned.
By the way, a man named Nishi
called all the papers last night
to announce a press conference.
That was done...
at my own behest.
But given what's transpired,
it can wait until another time.
Iwabuchi here.
What do you two want?
- I wish I had my rifle.
- What?
If I had my rifle,
I could shoot you.
What is this nonsense?
Look at Yoshiko.
When you killed Nishi,
you killed her too.
- Yoshiko.
- Stay back!
She's no longer your daughter,
and I'm no longer your son.
We never want
to see your face again.
That's all I came to say.
Tatsuo! Yoshiko!
Yes, Iwabuchi speaking.
Please forgive the interruption.
Everything's been laid to rest.
I'm sorry
for all the concern I caused you.
And with respect
to my own position,
I believe I should resign
for the good of Public Corp.
What?
Go abroad temporarily?
Yes, yes.
That's actually exactly
what I had in mind.
I do hope you'll consider
my future upon my return.
Good night, then.
Oh, my mistake.
I didn't sleep at all last night and
seem to have mistaken night for day.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
THE BAD SLEEP WELL
THE END
