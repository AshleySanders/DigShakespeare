# DigShakespeare
This repository contains files and information for the Spring 2018 Harvey Mudd Course Lit 179W: Global/Digital Shakespeare. It is available at: https://ashleysanders.github.io/DigShakespeare/.

Here is a brief (and not yet comprehensive) list of what you can expect to find in this repository:

•	The Hamlet folder contains the play split by scene and the soliloquies. 
•	HamByChar is Hamlet split by characters. 
•	The Othello folder contains lists of bigrams with the characters’ names, as well as the word “Moor." 
•	The collocation Python script that Meera Chowhan wrote to identify the bigrams is labeled Oth_char.py. 
•	ShakeTragedies is, not surprisingly, Shakespeare’s nine tragedies, downloaded from the Folger Shakespeare Library. (The entire corpus of Shakespeare’s works are available for download from the Folger, as is a corpus of Early Modern work!)
•	The files that have names beginning with “filtered” removed all the character name speaking prompts but they retain references to characters’ names when they appear in dialog. This means that you can focus on just the dialog in your analysis.
